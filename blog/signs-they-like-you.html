                <p class="intro">The early stages of attraction are filled with uncertainty. Do they feel the same way? Are they just being friendly? Reading signals wrong can lead to missed opportunities or awkward situations. This guide helps you decode the signs of genuine romantic interest—and distinguish them from simple friendliness.</p>

                <h2>Body Language Signs</h2>
                <p>Much of human communication is non-verbal. When someone is attracted to you, their body often reveals it before their words do.</p>

                <h3>Eye Contact</h3>
                <p>Extended eye contact is one of the strongest indicators of attraction. If someone:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Holds your gaze longer than usual</li>
                    <li>Looks at you, looks away, then looks back</li>
                    <li>Catches your eye across a room</li>
                    <li>Has dilated pupils when looking at you</li>
                </ul>
                <p>...they're likely interested. The "triangle gaze"—eyes moving from your eyes to your lips and back—is especially telling.</p>

                <h3>Physical Proximity</h3>
                <p>People naturally move closer to those they're attracted to. Notice if they:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stand or sit closer than necessary</li>
                    <li>Lean in when you're talking</li>
                    <li>Find excuses to be near you</li>
                    <li>Don't pull away when you move closer</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Touch</h3>
                <p>Light, casual touch often indicates interest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Touching your arm during conversation</li>
                    <li>Playful pushing or nudging</li>
                    <li>Finding excuses to make physical contact</li>
                    <li>Lingering hugs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mirroring</h3>
                <p>When attracted, people unconsciously mirror each other's body language. They might adopt your posture, copy your gestures, or match your speaking pace.</p>

                <h3>Preening</h3>
                <p>Self-grooming behaviors signal attraction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixing their hair</li>
                    <li>Adjusting clothing</li>
                    <li>Checking their appearance</li>
                    <li>Standing taller or improving posture when you're around</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Verbal and Communication Signs</h2>

                <h3>They Initiate Contact</h3>
                <p>If they regularly reach out first—texting, calling, making plans—they're investing effort. Someone who only responds but never initiates is showing less interest.</p>

                <h3>They Remember Details</h3>
                <p>Remembering small things you mentioned—your favorite coffee, an upcoming exam, your pet's name—shows they're paying attention because they care.</p>

                <h3>They Ask Questions</h3>
                <p>Genuine curiosity about your life indicates interest. They want to know about your past, your dreams, your opinions—because they want to know YOU.</p>

                <h3>They Find Reasons to Talk to You</h3>
                <p>Reaching out about minor things, sending memes or articles "that reminded me of you," or creating excuses for conversation all show you're on their mind.</p>

                <h3>Their Communication Is Consistent</h3>
                <p>Regular, reliable communication suggests investment. Hot-and-cold patterns often indicate mixed feelings or game-playing.</p>

                <h3>They Compliment You</h3>
                <p>Compliments beyond basic politeness—especially about your personality, intelligence, or unique qualities—suggest attraction.</p>

                <h2>Behavioral Signs</h2>

                <h3>They Prioritize You</h3>
                <p>Making time for you despite a busy schedule, choosing you over other options, or rearranging plans to see you all demonstrate priority.</p>

                <h3>They're Nervous Around You</h3>
                <p>Some nervousness—fidgeting, stumbling over words, blushing—can indicate attraction. They care about impressing you.</p>

                <h3>They Pay Attention</h3>
                <p>Putting away their phone, facing you fully, and giving undivided attention shows you matter to them.</p>

                <h3>They Include You</h3>
                <p>Inviting you to activities, introducing you to friends, or wanting to be part of your social world suggests they want you in their life.</p>

                <h3>They Try to Impress You</h3>
                <p>Sharing achievements, showing off skills, or going extra effort on their appearance around you all suggest they want your admiration.</p>

                <h3>They Get Jealous</h3>
                <p>Some jealousy when you mention other romantic prospects can indicate they see you as more than a friend. (Though excessive jealousy is a red flag.)</p>

                <h2>Signs They're Just Being Friendly</h2>
                <p>It's important to distinguish friendliness from attraction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They treat you the same as everyone else</li>
                    <li>They talk about their dating life or crushes on others</li>
                    <li>They don't initiate contact—only respond</li>
                    <li>There's no physical touch beyond what they give friends</li>
                    <li>They explicitly call you a friend or talk about you like one</li>
                    <li>They don't seem nervous or try to impress you</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Context Matters</h2>
                <p>No single sign is definitive. Consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cultural differences:</strong> Some cultures are more physically affectionate or have different eye contact norms</li>
                    <li><strong>Personality:</strong> Extroverts may seem flirty with everyone; introverts may hide interest</li>
                    <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Someone might flirt when drinking but not be genuinely interested</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Look for consistent behavior, not one-off instances</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When In Doubt...</h2>
                <p>The clearest way to know if someone likes you is to express interest and see how they respond. Yes, this requires vulnerability. But clarity is better than endless analysis of ambiguous signals.</p>

                <p>A simple "I'd love to take you to dinner sometime" or "I really enjoy spending time with you—would you want to go on a date?" directly addresses the question. Their response will tell you everything you need to know.</p>
